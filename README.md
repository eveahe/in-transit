# In Transit Ghost Theme

In Transit is a simple theme for the [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) platform. The name is mainly because I started writing this theme while on a long train ride. 

I initially had tried building my own theme from a few different theme templates but found myself confused as to what parts of the theme scaffold were required, what parts were optional and how they all fit together. This theme was intially built by following along to [this very wonderful tutorial](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/series/building-a-ghost-theme-from-scratch--webdesign-16179) by someone named Kezz Bracey. It's from 2013, but it's wonderfully detailed and there's a post at the end detailing some of the ways Ghost has developed since then. 

# Theme Characteristics
This theme is meant for a simple personal blog -- there are no author pages or author details, because it is assumed that there will be only one author. 

The theme is also meant for a blog that will be writing-heavy -- you can upload images, and there's some image styling, but the homepage is just a list of blog post titles and links, without snippets or images. 

I created my own theme partly because I found menu sidebar in many of the free templates too heavy. Instead, In Transit has a simple navigation on the top of the page. Any pages that you create as static pages in Ghost and then add to Navigation will show up here.

You can preview the theme by checking out my own blog at [eveahe.online](https://eveahe.online).

# How to Use 
My own blog is hosted on Glitch, at the moment. It's great and also it's free. [Here](https://phocks.github.io/ghost-2-on-glitch.html) is a great (and short) tutorial if you're interested in doing the same. 

In order to install In Transit as a theme (or any theme for that matter), you need to either 1) have the theme files in the content/theme folder of your blog or, once you have a Ghost blog running on Glitch, you can clone this repo, zip the files and upload it as a new theme in the admin section of your blog. 

The theme is very much primary color heavy at the moment, but that can be adjusted :D. 

There are some parts of the code that are commented out because they represent Ghost theme features that I am not using at the moment but might want to in the future (or that you might want to use as well). Please enjoy!
